                <h2> This webpage is all about my favorite super heroes of all time. 
                    In the world of comic books and fantasy literature, there have been a multitude of amazing superheroes. 
                    Each superhero has their own unique set of skills and personalities. A hero could have very many different definitions, 
                    like it could be a role model of yours, or it could be a hero from ancestry.
                     My definition of a hero would be someone that has super natural abilities and uses those abilities to help keep people from damage. 
                     There are many different heroes in the world and i chose to write about Iron Man because not only is he an awesome hero, 
                     but he is also a very successful person, being the owner of Starks Industry, and making it better by improving the weapons they make. 
                     At the same time that he is saving the world he is also a very hard working person.</h2>

                <h1>Batman</h1>
                <img src="img/batman.jpg" style="width:80%">
                <h2>
                    I’ve been a huge Batman fan for at least 8–9 years, Batman is a hero to me because I have learned many good things from him. 
                    He has showed me that it is better to care for everybody than just the people who are close to you. 
                    He has also taught me that you don't need powers to be a hero, 
                    and that even if you have a lot of money you should still go out of your way to help people who aren't as fortunate as you. 
                    He has also taught me some pretty sweet fighting moves. He is also my hero because he has always been my favorite super hero
                     and I have always looked up to him. Batman was my favorite cartoon when I was a kid and The Dark Knight is my favorite movie. 
                     He is my hero because he stands for everything that is good in the world.

                <h1>IronMan</h1>
                <img src="img/3000.jpg" style="width:80%">
                <h2>
                        Iron Man is a hero for many reasons, like i talked about in my last paragraph, those were just the little reasons. 
                        Now it's time for the major reasons why he is a hero. 
                        One would be because he saves many people by creating the guns that he creates for the U.S. Army. 
                        Then there is where he ends the manufacturing of Iron Man suits because they are causing nothing but trouble and he is 
                        left with just one for himself so that he can help our country, 
                        but at the same time all the chaos from all the Iron Man suits being made is ended. Then his actions he makes are all heroic; 
                        he makes good decisions on what to do when he is making his weapons and making the suits. In the imaginary real world he does good actions 
                        that are heroic.

                <h1>Joker</h1>
                <img src="img/joker.jpg" style="width:80%">
                <h2>
                        Whether you are die-hard comic book fan or a guy on the street who knows next to nothing about comics, 
                        you know who The Joker is; talk about any top list from the greatest villain of all time to DC comics top villain,
                        Joker has hardly ever missed the top spot. Though the Joker has fought many superheroes from DC universe, 
                        namely the Superman and the Wonder woman; his last stand was always facing the dark vigilante who looks over the Gotham city; the Batman. 
                        The Joker is a yin to the Batman’s yang; he just cannot fathom the idea of Batman’s morality and has become obsessed to make 
                        Batman see the error of his ways.
                        The character of The Joker was created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson for the debut issue of 
                        the Batman comics on April of 1940. The character of the Joker was initially planned to be killed by the end of the first
                        arc, but his popularity among the fans become the key to his survival and now, even after 75 years, 
                        he is still known as one of the greatest villainous character ever written. Joker is certifiably insane, mass murdering 
                        lunatic, he is truly a rebel without a cause. like his counterpart, the Batman, the Joker has no super power or special 
                        ability but unlike the Batman he has no cause to do what he does. The Clown Prince of Crime creates mayhem for the sake 
                        of chaos, and this makes him actually the most dangerous villain. Without further due let’s get on to the reasons why the 
                        Joker is the ultimate villain of all time.

                <h2>
                        Deadpool is the merch with a mouth. Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a former Special Forces operative who 
                        now works as a mercenary. His world comes crashing down when evil scientist Ajax (Ed Skrein) tortures, 
                        disfigures and transforms him into Deadpool. The rogue experiment leaves Deadpool with accelerated healing powers 
                        and a twisted sense of humor. With help from mutant allies Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand), 
                        Deadpool uses his new skills to hunt down the man who nearly destroyed his life. Wade Wilson was born in Canada, 
                        but grew up to become the least Canadian person ever. When it comes to the Merc with a Mouth, with great power 
                        comes no responsibility.
