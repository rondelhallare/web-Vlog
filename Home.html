                <h2> This webpage is all about my favorite super heroes of all time. 
                    In the world of comic books and fantasy literature, there have been a multitude of amazing superheroes. 
                    Each superhero has their own unique set of skills and personalities. A hero could have very many different definitions, 
                    like it could be a role model of yours, or it could be a hero from ancestry.
                     My definition of a hero would be someone that has super natural abilities and uses those abilities to help keep people from damage. 
                     There are many different heroes in the world and i chose to write about Iron Man because not only is he an awesome hero, 
                     but he is also a very successful person, being the owner of Starks Industry, and making it better by improving the weapons they make. 
                     At the same time that he is saving the world he is also a very hard working person.</h2>

                <h1>Batman</h1>
                <img src="img/batman.jpg">
                    <h2>
                        I’ve been a huge Batman fan for at least 8–9 years, Batman is a hero to me because I have learned many good things from him. 
                        He has showed me that it is better to care for everybody than just the people who are close to you. 
                        He has also taught me that you don't need powers to be a hero, 
                        and that even if you have a lot of money you should still go out of your way to help people who aren't as fortunate as you. 
                        He has also taught me some pretty sweet fighting moves. He is also my hero because he has always been my favorite super hero
                        and I have always looked up to him. Batman was my favorite cartoon when I was a kid and The Dark Knight is my favorite movie. 
                        He is my hero because he stands for everything that is good in the world.

                <h1>IronMan</h1>
                <img src="img/3000.jpg"">
                    <h2>
                        I love you 3000. Iron Man is a hero for many reasons, he is one of the smartest and wittiest characters in the marvel universe 
                        or in any comicbook universe for that matter. Ironman thought me that brains alone cannot sufice, one must have heart. 
                        for me the best depiction of Ironman or Tony Stark is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe(MCU), he is a Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. 
                        who learns to be a better person, who will do what is right.Iron Man exhibits another characteristic essential to the idea of a superhero. 
                        His high level intelligence allows him to create technology that provides him superpowers and assists him in adeptly escaping tough situations. 
                        Through his intelligence, Iron Man skillfully outmaneuvers his opponents and thwarts any plans they may conjure.I like Iron Man because he proved 
                        that a human could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with demigods and super soldiers. With just his intellect, ingenuity and a couple million bucks,
                         Iron Man is a self-made hero. Too bad all rich folks don’t spend their money that way.

                <h1>Joker</h1>
                <img src="img/joker.jpg">
                    <h2>
                        Whether you are die-hard comic book fan or a guy on the street who knows next to nothing about comics, 
                        you know who The Joker is; talk about any top list from the greatest villain of all time to DC comics top villain,
                        Joker has hardly ever missed the top spot. Though the Joker has fought many superheroes from DC universe, 
                        namely the Superman and the Wonder woman; his last stand was always facing the dark vigilante who looks over the Gotham city; the Batman. 
                        The Joker is a yin to the Batman’s yang; he just cannot fathom the idea of Batman’s morality and has become obsessed to make 
                        Batman see the error of his ways.
                    </h2>
                <h1>Deadpool</h1>
                <img src="img/deadpool.jpg">
                    <h2>
                        Deadpool is the merch with a mouth. Wade Wilson  is a former Special Forces operative who now works as a mercenary. 
                        Deadpool is aware that he is a fictional comic book character. He commonly breaks the fourth wall, which is done
                        by few other characters in the Marvel Universe, and this is used to humorous effect. He often has conversations with 
                        his two internal monologues, which are shown as caption boxes in his panels. The character's back-story has been
                        presented as vague and subject to change, and within the narrative he is unable to remember his personal history due 
                        to a mental condition.
